# DO NOT USE THIS FORK
It is slow, tailored to my personal needs, removes support for most text-to-speech software, has bad coding practices...

## Why this fork?
I wasn't satisfied with the choice of tts software in this script, so I added festival support instead, and removed support for everything else.

## Why publish it?
I wanted to be able to quickly pull my fork on my many computers, and github doesn't allow changing the visibility of forks.
Hopefully my fork will be useful to someone else.
